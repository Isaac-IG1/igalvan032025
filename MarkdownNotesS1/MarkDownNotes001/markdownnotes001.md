# Biodiversity and stability

## Stability

1. **Interactions**

   1. Predation

   2. Competition

   3. Symbiosis

   4. Mutualism

   5. Commensalism

   6. Parasitism

#

1. **Biodiversity**

   1. Life

#

1. **Keystone Species**

   1. Large impact

   - They keep balance if removed can see a trophic cascade (Domino effect)

#

### More Biodiversity = More stability

# Resistant vs. Resilience

**Resistant:**

- Ability of an ecosystem or poplution to withstand change

_Key Idea:_ **Stays stable even w/change**

#

**Reslilience:**

- Ability of ecosystem or poplution to bounce back after change

_Key Idea:_ **Bounces back after change**
